### Projects

__*The purpose here is to learn c++ through hands-on projects. When I was looking up C++ intermediate/advanced projects, system-level projects showed up such as creating a custom filesystem, database systems, or even compiler for a custom language, etc. The initial skeleton layout helps with a quick headstart. Continuing to build upon these projects, would further solidify system-level foundational concepts and programming knowledge.*__

Claude hits rate-limit too early lately. So, I start with Grok now because grok is a beast and limitless. And with claude's github integration, it would be easier to add further enhancements or more features to a specific project folder and keep building up on it. That's what I am planning to do here for these projects.

With regards to the learning aspect, you won't be building anything from scratch at almost 95% of the places. It would be a small piece, a specific module that you would be assigned and team dynamics will be at play as well. Plus reading and understanding someone else's code is the most essential skill in real-world projects. In this case, it just happens to be AI slop and not human. A novel approach I would say. 

All of these are **extras** anyway to let the programming skills not rot in dust. I have been saying this since the day I started my github. It's purely for upskilling purposes but unintentionally happened to attract companies sending out rejects for even thinking of committing such a heinous crime. Like how dare you think for yourself and decide to invest in your own growth without seeking our advice first? 

It has primarily been our job to tell you what to learn, what not to learn, which tech stack is the best and right for you and where you belong in the overall tech realm, and so and so. Please give me a break!! Anyway coming back to the post, don't critique my technique too hard. Appreciate whatever you are getting for free on the Internet.
