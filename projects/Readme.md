### Projects

__*The purpose here is to learn c++ through hands-on projects. When I was looking up C++ intermediate/advanced projects, system-level projects showed up such as creating a custom filesystem, database systems, or even compiler for a custom language, etc. The initial skeleton layout helps with a quick headstart. Continuing to build upon these projects, would further solidify system-level foundational concepts and programming knowledge.*__
