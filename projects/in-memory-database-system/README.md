### Implementation Notes

Modularity: Each component (Storage, Index, TransactionManager, UserManager) is encapsulated in its own class, with clear interfaces defined in header files.
Memory Management: Uses std::unique_ptr for automatic resource management and to prevent memory leaks.
Concurrency: The Storage class uses a mutex to ensure thread-safe operations. Further concurrency can be added by extending mutex usage in other components.
Indexing: The Index class uses a simplified std::map as a B+ tree substitute for fast lookups. A real B+ tree can be implemented for better performance.
Transactions: The TransactionManager logs operations and supports commit/rollback, ensuring data integrity.
User Management: Role-based permissions are implemented, with admin and reader roles defined. Additional roles can be added as needed.
Build System: CMake is used for cross-platform compatibility and ease of building.

To build and run:

- Create a build directory: mkdir build && cd build
- Run CMake: cmake ..
- Build: cmake --build .
- Run the main program: ./database
- Run tests:
    - cd tests
    - g++ -I../include -o test_main test_main.cpp ../src/database.cpp ../src/storage.cpp ../src/index.cpp ../src/transaction.cpp ../src/user_manager.cpp -std=c++17
    - ./test_main

This structure provides a solid foundation for a database system, with room for further optimization and feature expansion.

### Prompt

Custom Database or File System 

This ambitious project demonstrates a deep understanding of computer science fundamentals, data persistence, and low-level system design.
What it shows:
Systems Design: The ability to design and implement a complex system from the ground up.
Memory Management: Sophisticated use of memory to manage data storage and retrieval.
Concurrency: If you add multi-user support, you can demonstrate the use of mutexes and other concurrency primitives.
Advanced features to implement:
Indexing: Implement indexing to allow for fast data searching and retrieval.
Transactions: Create a system for rolling back and committing changes to maintain data integrity.
User Management: Add support for different users with varying permission levels.
